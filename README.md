# 1024 Game in C++

Welcome to the 1024 Game, a console-based puzzle game implemented in C++. This project is a simple yet engaging adaptation of the popular 2048 game, challenging players to combine numbered tiles to reach the coveted 1024 tile.

## How to Play:

  - Press 'Q' to quit the game at any time.

- **Gameplay:**
  - On each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear on the board.
  - Tiles with the same value can be combined by moving them towards each other.
  - The game ends when the player reaches the 1024 tile or there are no more valid moves.
